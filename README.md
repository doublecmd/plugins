This repository contains some official and third-party Double Commander plugins written or ported to Linux (FreeBSD, macOS).

Double Commander uses [Total Commander](http://www.ghisler.com) plugin API,
so under Microsoft Windows you can use [plugins from Total Commander](http://totalcmd.net).

Binaries for Linux (x86_64) can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/doublecmd/plugins/releases) section, or see specific plugin directory for installation instructions (e.g. `wcx/diskdir/installation.md`)
