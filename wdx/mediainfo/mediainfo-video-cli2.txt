mediainfo-video-cli2.lua
2019.04.30

Get some technical information about video files.

Uses CLI-version of MediaInfo (as mediainfo-video.lua), but:
- In some cases this version will be more faster (if you want to use 3 or more fields);
- In some cases this version will be more slower (if you want to use searching with plugin and 1 or 2 fields);
- Fields "Video: Width x Height", "General:", "Video:" and "Audio:" have been removed, because they are not needed in this version.
